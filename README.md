# Power of Metaclasses
This repository contains presentation slides and demo scripts from Mobile EMEA Summit - Czech Republic 2019.

## Presentation
Presentation is written in markdown format. Any markdown reader should be able to parse it. In the presentation I used [mdp](https://github.com/visit1985/mdp).

## Demo
If you're using python, you can load `vimrc` which contains pre-recorded macros `@a` - `@k` with steps to implement the solution.

### Tests
Tests and scripts are written for Python 3.6 with Pytest 4.3.

Run `py.test` to run all tests. Or `py.test -v --tb=line` to display only summary of failed tests.
