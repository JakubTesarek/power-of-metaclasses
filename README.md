# Power of Metaclasses
This repository contains presentation slides and demo scripts from Mobile EMEA Summit - Czech Republic 2019.

## Presentation
Presentation is written in markdown format. Any markdown reader should be able to parse it. In the presentation I used [mdp](https://github.com/visit1985/mdp).

## Tests
Tests and scripts are written for Python 3.6 with Pytest 4.3.

Run `py.test` to run all tests.
